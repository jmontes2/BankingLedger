Homework: Variable Type vs Object Type

1.Which of the followings is considered boxing?

a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx; ******** this one **********
d. int ix = objy;


2.Which of the following is considered unboxing?

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy; ******** this one *********


3.Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;


4.Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object to another variable of type double.

double dx = (float)objflx; // implicitly cast since we are not losing precision.  Could also have double dx = (double)(float)objflx; but is not necessary.


5.Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = double.Parse(strx);


6.Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = ix; // implicitly cast since we are not losing precision.  Could also have float fx = (float)ix; but is not necessary.


7.Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx = dblx.ToString();


8.Object is the *base* class of all other data types.


9.What is an object (the definition)?
An object can be an object type, or an instanstiated type.  Instanstiated type is created from a class, but this has not been covered yet.
An object type has definition, values, and functions(purpose).

10.How do you declare an object in C#?
object objVariable;

What is the difference between an object and a variable?
An object can contain any data type.  Once it stores a value, the data type is unknown unless requested.
